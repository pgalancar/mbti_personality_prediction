MBTI Personality Prediction Project
Overview
This project explores predicting MBTI personality types from text data using machine learning. We utilized an XGBoost model trained on MBTI and Personality Cafe forums, and applied it to the Ubuntu Dialog Corpus, which lacks ground truth labels. To address this, we used ChatGPT to generate pseudo-labels and assess the modelâ€™s performance.

Objectives and Methodology
Our primary aim was to train an XGBoost model on labeled MBTI datasets and evaluate its ability to predict personality types on new, unlabeled data from the Ubuntu Dialog Corpus. Due to the absence of true labels in this corpus, we employed ChatGPT to create pseudo-labels for a sample of texts. This approach allowed us to compare the predictions of the XGBoost model with those generated by ChatGPT.

Results and Insights
The project found that while the exact match rate between XGBoost and ChatGPT labels was low, with only 13% of predictions being an exact match, there was significant alignment in the personality traits identified. Specifically, the average similarity in dichotomies between the two models was 70%, indicating that despite differing overall predictions, both models often agreed on the underlying personality traits.
